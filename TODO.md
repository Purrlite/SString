TODO list
=========

 - Test which versions of functions are fastest and remove the redundant ones.
 - Add checks for NULL at the start of all functions
 - Check if I can add some keywords (even compiler specific) to speed it up
 - Make consistent equality checks with the value on the left side and variable on the right.
 - Improve the names of functions to me more readable instead of being like standard C functions.
 - Add an insert function
